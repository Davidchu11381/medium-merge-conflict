# What is this about?

This is a repository for demonstrating merge conflicts - to support my [medium blog post](https://medium.com/@RedRoxProjects)

* In the Web UI section I cover how to resolve merge conflicts across pull requests using the GitHub web UI. 

* In the Desktop UI section I show you how to resolve merge conflicts across local branches. 

You can read the blog post to find out more :heart:
