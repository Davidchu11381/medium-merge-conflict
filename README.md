# What is this about?

This is a repository for demonstrating merge conflicts - to support my [medium blog post](https://medium.com/@RedRoxProjects). 

* First we learnt about using the GitHub Web UI through creating a repository and handling a merge conflict from a Pull Request. 

* Second we cover using the command line and how to handle merge conflicts between local and remote repositories. :sparkles:

* Third we will look at the GitHub Desktop Application and what merges look like on this :heart:

You can read the blog post to find out more :heart:
